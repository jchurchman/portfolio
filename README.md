# portfolio

Hey there! My name is Joe Churchman. Thanks for stopping by and checking my portfolio repository!

It's always going to be in the works, but it's pretty young still.

I'll be working on populating this repo with fun coding projects (as I write them).

Take what you find in here with a grain of salt.

If you want to learn a bit more about me, check out my [LinkedIn](www.linkedinprofilelinkhere.com).

You can also see more of my coding examples in my [older repositories](www.joesgithublink.com).
